02/15/22: I trained 30 linear models using sklearn. I calculated the average targets over all 40 models for my first submission.

02/20/22: Random-walk based prediction for lower correlated asset classes (time correlaton of returns < 0.35) and lasso regression based models for higher correlated' securities.

03/04/2022: Split data into asset classes with low number of observations and high # of observations. After that split high number of observations category into high and low correlated data. We apply different models on the datasets.
